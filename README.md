# yerbaMate
This program was created to help my coworkers count inventory every week.

Load the index.html page and input values into the fields provided.

The program should perform tests to make sure the values entered are integers between 0 and 999,999.

The program should then calculate the total number of cases on hand by performing the following simple calculation:

((number of rows) * 20) + (number of non-row cases) = total

the program then passes the total to a div and displays the total of each flavor on hand

it also styles the div to be clearly visible and easily readable

//future plans for the program:

- Sparkler support
- Glass support
- Loose Leaf support
- Cleaner JavaScript
  - Recursive functions / callbacks (I need to lean how to do this first)
- Program rewrite
  - Solve using an array instead of simple arithmetic
- Investigate more meaningful ways to use the data entered here
- Export to .CSV
- Export to Slack
- Export to Encompass (this is a significant undertaking)
- more
